/**
 * > **Ported from Cards**, where it was written after four production ANRs.
 * > Cards also found this rule silently undispatched on detekt `2.0.0-alpha.5`
 * > — registered, configured active, compiled into the jar, and never called,
 * > which is indistinguishable from a working rule that finds nothing. That did
 * > *not* reproduce here (this repo's rules dispatch on alpha.5 and alpha.6
 * > alike, verified by making one report unconditionally), but the lesson
 * > stands: if a custom rule appears to do nothing, prove dispatch with an
 * > unconditional report rather than trusting a clean run.
 * >
 * > In Cards it found **19 violations on its first real run**, seven of them in
 * > files that had just been swept by hand for this exact pattern. See ENG-54.
 *
 * Flags `val x by animateFloatAsState(...)`, and its siblings, inside a
 * composable.
 *
 * The `by` delegate unwraps the `State<T>` **during composition**, which
 * subscribes the enclosing composable to a value that changes every animation
 * frame. Everything in that scope then recomposes at 60fps for as long as the
 * animation runs, whether or not anything it draws actually changed.
 *
 * This is not theoretical. It is ENG-49, and it cost four production ANRs:
 * `PlayerArea` read a pulsing alpha this way, so the player's name, chip count
 * and hand label recomposed 471 times in a 25-second trace. Rebuilding that
 * text every frame thrashed Skia's glyph cache and wedged the RenderThread hard
 * enough that anything else needing it — opening a dialog, closing one, drawing
 * an ordinary frame — hung past the ANR threshold. Fixing it dropped
 * `PlayerArea` from 471 recompositions to 6.
 *
 * It also hid a second instance of itself: `HoleCardSlot` had the same bug in
 * three places, invisible until the first was fixed. That is what this rule is
 * for — the instance nobody has found yet.
 *
 * **The fix** is to keep the `State` and read it where it is cheapest:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * // Recomposes every frame:
 * val alpha by animateFloatAsState(target)
 * Modifier.graphicsLayer { this.alpha = alpha }
 *
 * // Recomposes never; the draw phase alone invalidates:
 * val alpha = animateFloatAsState(target)
 * Modifier.graphicsLayer { this.alpha = alpha.value }
 * ```
 *
 * **When composition genuinely needs the value** — usually because it decides
 * which composable to emit — derive the narrower thing it actually needs, so
 * you recompose on that instead of on every frame:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val showingFace by remember { derivedStateOf { rotation.value <= 90f } }
 * ```
 *
 * If neither applies, `@Suppress("AnimatedStateReadInComposition")` with a
 * comment saying why. A per-frame recomposition that is genuinely required is
 * fine; one nobody noticed is what causes ANRs.
