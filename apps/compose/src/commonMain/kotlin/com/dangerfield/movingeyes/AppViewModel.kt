/**
 * App-level ViewModel. Resolves the start destination by reading the
 * persistent `AppData` cache — onboarded users land on [HomeRoute];
 * first-launch users land on [OnboardingRoute].
 *
 * Scoped as singleton so Android's splash-screen API can read the same
 * instance used by the App composable.
 *
 * `startDestination` is a [StateFlow] that's `null` until the cache read
 * completes. The App composable blocks NavHost construction on a non-null
 * value, keeping the splash visible during the brief async read.
 *
 * Two readiness signals drive a two-stage boot:
 *  - [isReady] flips as soon as the start destination is resolved. It
 *    releases the platform splash (Android's native splash API / iOS's
 *    splash overlay) so it hands off to the Compose boot gate.
 *  - [isBootComplete] flips once the remaining boot work finishes: the
 *    unauthed app-config has resolved (or timed out) and — for returning
 *    users — the first [ProfileRepository.observe] emission has landed.
 *    The Compose boot gate shows the cycling loading caption until this is
 *    true, then renders the real nav graph.
 *
 * Holding the gate on app-config means the first screen renders real
 * config-driven values on frame one instead of the "server hasn't told us
 * yet" sentinel; holding it on the profile resolve means a returning user's
 * home renders authoritative state on frame one, not a stale cache flash.
 *
 * The iOS splash-overlay state lives inside the [App] composable itself, not
 * here — keeping it out of the reactive app state means flipping it cannot
 * trigger a root recomposition (which previously caused the NavHost to re-emit
 * its start destination).
