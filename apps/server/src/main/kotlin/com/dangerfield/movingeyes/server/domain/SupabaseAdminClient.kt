/**
 * Wrapper for the Supabase Admin REST API — the surface that requires the
 * project's `service_role` JWT instead of a user-issued one.
 *
 * V1 only needs user deletion (App Store and Play Store both require an
 * in-app "delete my account" path). Add new methods here as needs grow;
 * keep them sealed-outcome-typed so callers can branch on misconfiguration
 * vs. upstream failure without try/catch ceremony.
 *
 * Implementations talk to `<projectUrl>/auth/v1/admin/...` with the
 * service-role bearer + apikey headers Supabase requires. Tests bind a
 * fake — see `MeRoutesTest.FakeSupabaseAdminClient`.

     * The full result lives in memory by design — V1 is small enough that
     * a single sweep returns <10k users in the worst case. If we grow past
