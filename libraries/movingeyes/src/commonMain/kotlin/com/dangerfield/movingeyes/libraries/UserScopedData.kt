/**
 * A device-local store whose contents belong to a single signed-in user —
 * Room tables (chips, XP, inventory, …), the profile mirror, account-scoped
 * settings. Implementations wipe the **departing** user's data whenever the
 * active user changes: an account switch (anon → existing account) or a
 * sign-out / delete.
 *
 * Contributed as an [AppScope][software.amazon.lastmile.kotlin.inject.anvil.AppScope]
 * multibinding; [UserScopedDataReset] collects the whole set and runs them
 * as one "dump." Adding a new store is a compile-time wire-up (contribute a
 * binding), not a list edit.
 *
 * ## Ordering contract
 *
 * [clear] runs *before* the auth layer emits the new [AuthState] (see
 * `SupabaseAuthRepositoryImpl.emitLocked`). That ordering is the whole point:
 * the incoming user's reactive loaders (e.g. `ProfileRepository` re-resolving
 * on the auth change) only wake on the new emission, so they cannot race the
 * wipe and lose freshly-fetched data.
 *
 * Keep implementations self-contained: a local wipe only. **No network** — we
 * may already hold the new user's session, so any call would either 401 or
 * worse, fetch the new user's data into a store we're about to clear. **No
 * calls back into the auth layer** — clears run inside an auth transition.

/**
 * Background work bound to a single user — sync loops, reconcile passes —
 * that must stop before that user's local data is wiped. A sync mid-flight
 * for the departing user would otherwise race the wipe: its writes can land
 * in a store the clearers just emptied, leaking the old user's data into the
 * new user's session.
 *
 * Contributed as a multibinding; [UserScopedDataReset] runs every stopper
 * **before** any [UserScopedClearer], awaiting each, so the wipe starts only
 * once the departing user's work has actually finished cancelling.

/**

 * this at the single point where it knows the active user id changed, so no
 * individual sign-in / switch / sign-out / delete path has to remember to
 * trigger cleanup — the old "every caller dispatches `SignedOut`" footgun.
 *
 * Failures in one clearer are logged and swallowed so a single bad store can't
 * block the rest of the dump (or the auth transition that awaits it).
