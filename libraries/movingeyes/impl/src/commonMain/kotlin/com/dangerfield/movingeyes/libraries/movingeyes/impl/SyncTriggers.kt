/**
 * The app-state levels and edges that data-freshness work hangs off, derived

 * - [activeAccount] — level; from [AuthRepository.observe], which replays the
 *   resolved state to late subscribers (no boot race) and emits only *after*
 *   the departing user's local data is cleared (a new user's sync can never
 *   race the old user's wipe).
 * - [warmForeground] — edge; app resumed with a session already live. Reads
 *   the replay-free stream so a stale pre-subscribe foreground can't
 *   double-fire at activation. Cold-boot foregrounds are excluded: boot syncs
 *   belong to [activeAccount] firing when auth resolves.
 * - [cameOnline] — edge; connectivity regained, derived from the
 *   [AppState.isOffline] level (not the replayed [AppEvent.ConnectivityRegained]
 *   edge, which could spuriously refire at boot from the bus's replay slot).
 *   Initial value dropped, flaps debounced.
