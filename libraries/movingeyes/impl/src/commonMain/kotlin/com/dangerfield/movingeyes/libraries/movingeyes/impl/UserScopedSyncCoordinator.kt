/**
 * Single owner of the "when do user-scoped stores reconcile with the server"
 * policy. One level-based `runWhen` per [UserScopedSyncer]: sync whenever an
 * account is active (including already-active at subscribe — the lost-edge
 * boot race can't happen against a level), re-sync on warm foreground and on
 * connectivity returning, retry failures with backoff while the account holds.
 *
 * Per-syncer loops are independent: a failing wallet sync retries alone
 * without re-running the other stores, and each loop is single-flight with
 * trailing coalesce. Sign-out cancels in-flight syncs and pending backoff; a
 * user switch or a guest claiming their account (same id, `isAnonymous` flips)
 * is a key change that cancels and fires fresh.
 *
 * Each cycle runs [UserScopedWorkRegistry.tracked] so a user switch can also
 * cancel it *synchronously with the data clear* — the key-change cancellation
 * above only lands once the new auth emission reaches these loops, which is
 * after the departing user's stores were already wiped.
 *
 * [AutoInit] so the loops attach at boot before the user can navigate.
