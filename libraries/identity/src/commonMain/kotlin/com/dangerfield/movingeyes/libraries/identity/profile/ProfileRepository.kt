 * to resolve before fetching: an authenticated session means
 * [Profile.Authenticated] from `/v1/me`; an unauthenticated state means
 * [Profile.Fallback] keyed on a stable client-generated UUID.
 *
 * **No in-flight sentinel.** [current] suspends until the answer is
 * real; [observe] emits only resolved profiles.

 * when `/v1/me` fails — the happy path is server-authoritative
 * end-to-end. Returning users on a healthy network see splash → home
 * with fresh data; returning users on an offline network fall back to
 * the cached profile via the `onFailure` branch.
