 * the user commits their name ([start]) and joins on the result at the
 * final step ([awaitTerminal]) — so the work runs in **app scope**, not the
 * onboarding ViewModel's scope, and survives the user paging through the
 * remaining onboarding steps.
 *
 * "Created" means an anonymous session now exists ([AuthRepository.createGuestSession]
 * succeeded); applying the chosen profile is best-effort on top (the server
 * already has a usable generated name either way). A failure to even establish
 * the session — i.e. offline — surfaces as [AccountCreationState.Failed], which
 * the degraded "we'll keep retrying" experience hangs off of and [retry] drives.
