/**
 * Owns the device's Supabase user lifecycle + access token.
 *
 * Sessions are never minted implicitly. Construction only hydrates whatever
 * session supabase-kt persisted; new sessions are created explicitly —
 * onboarding drives [createGuestSession] (via `GuestAccountCreator`), the
 * sign-in flows mint claimed ones, and `GuestSessionHealer` recovers a
 * stranded onboarded device. [retry] re-resolves a dormant session but never
 * mints. After init resolves, [current] / [observe] return either
 * [AuthState.Authenticated] or [AuthState.Unauthenticated] (whose
 * [AuthState.Unauthenticated.reason] says why: none/offline, session
 * expired, signed out).
 *
 * **No in-flight sentinel state.** [current] suspends until the answer
 * is real; [observe] emits only resolved values. UI that wants to render
 * a spinner should do so while waiting on its first emission.
 *
 * Errors from auth operations are returned as sealed outcome types
 * rather than thrown, because the UI wants to render specific messages
 * for "invalid credentials" vs "network down" vs "email already
 * registered." Try/catch at every call site was the worse alternative.
 *
 * **Access tokens live elsewhere.** The networking layer reads tokens via
 * `AuthTokenProvider` (in `:libraries:networking`), not through this
 * interface — keeping the network → auth dependency narrow at the type
 * level.
