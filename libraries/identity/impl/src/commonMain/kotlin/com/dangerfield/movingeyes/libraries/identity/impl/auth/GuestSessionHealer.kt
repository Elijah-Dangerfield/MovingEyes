/**
 * The *decider* for identity self-heal. Listens for the data-freshness triggers
 * — cold boot, warm boot, foreground (non-cold-boot), and connectivity-regained
 * — and, on each, asks "is this device stranded?": onboarded + online + genuinely
 * session-less (not a deliberate sign-out, not a server-killed session).
 *
 * When stranded it drives [GuestAccountCreator.ensureSession], which mints (or
 * finishes an owed) anonymous session. Success flips auth to Authenticated,
 * which fires the existing `UserChanged(null→X)` fan-out — re-syncing every
 * user-scoped repo and re-resolving `/v1/me` — so the healer doesn't have to
 * refresh anything itself. It only ever *creates the identity*; the rest rides
 * the machinery that already exists.
 *
 * **It never mints over an existing account** (AUTH-19): when a cached
 * server-backed profile survives locally but its session is gone (storage lost
 * the token across an upgrade), minting would silently strand that account's
 * progression behind a fresh empty guest. Instead the healer declares the
 * session unrecoverable ([AuthRepository.markSessionUnrecoverable]), which
 * routes the user to the explicit recovery screen.
 *
 * This is the permanent fix for the stranding bug: even if the durable pending
 * record was ever lost, the next foreground/connectivity edge recovers the user.
 *
 * Each trigger emits one structured decision line (see [HealAction]) so the old
 * silent failure is now observable; mint success/failure is logged too.
