/**
 * App-scoped [GuestAccountCreator]. Runs the create job on [AppCoroutineScope]
 * so it isn't tied to the onboarding ViewModel's lifecycle — the user can page
 * through the rest of onboarding (or the VM can be recreated) while creation is
 * in flight.
 *
 * Success is defined by an anonymous session existing; the profile apply is
 * best-effort (the server seeds a usable generated name on first contact, so a
 * failed patch just leaves that default in place — not a creation failure).
 *
 * **Durable + self-healing.** [start] persists the chosen identity via
 * [PendingGuestAccountStore] *before* attempting, and only clears it on success.
 * As an [AutoInit] it re-reads that store at app launch: if a guest account is
 * still owed (creation failed offline last session), it re-attempts immediately
 * — so a user who onboarded offline gets their real guest account the next time
 * the app opens online, with the same name, instead of being stranded as
 * a local-only Fallback forever.
