/**
 * Thin abstraction over supabase-kt's `Auth` plugin. Exists so
 * [SupabaseAuthRepositoryImpl] can be unit-tested without booting a real
 * `SupabaseClient` — there are no first-class testing utilities for the
 * supabase-kt 3.x auth plugin (no in-memory client, no HTTP engine slot),
 * so the wrapper is our seam.
 *
 * Contract:
 *  - Read-only methods ([currentStatus], [currentSession]) are non-suspending
 *    and observe whatever state supabase-kt currently holds. They never
 *    throw.
 *  - Mutating methods are suspending and propagate exceptions raw —
 *    `RestException`, `HttpRequestException`, and other supabase-kt errors
 *    surface unchanged so [SupabaseAuthRepositoryImpl] can map them to its
 *    `*Outcome` sealed hierarchies. The wrapper is intentionally NOT a
 *    place where errors get translated.
 *
 * Production impl: [RealSupabaseAuthGateway] (wraps `supabase.auth.*`).
 * Test impl: `FakeSupabaseAuthGateway` in commonTest.
