/**
 * Drives the two-step onboarding flow with **deferred account creation** —
 * no account exists on launch; one is minted only when the user commits.
 *   1. **Welcome** — "Continue as guest" advances to step 2 (no auth yet);
 *      "Apple"/"Google" sign-in: a returning account goes straight to Home, a
 *      brand-new one runs through the rest of onboarding (PickIdentity) like a
 *      guest. New-vs-returning comes from the server's new-account signal via
 *      [AuthOutcomeClassifier].
 *   2. **PickIdentity** — edit the display name (prefilled from a client
 *      suggestion). "Continue" kicks off guest-account creation
 *      ([GuestAccountCreator], app-scoped so it survives the ViewModel), joins
 *      on the result with a bounded wait, marks `hasUserOnboarded`, and goes
 *      Home. From here back is blocked — creation is in flight.
 *
 * **Why creation is deferred:** minting an anonymous account on launch leaves
 * an orphan whenever the user then signs into a real account. Onboarding runs
 * entirely unauthenticated, and the account is created at the point of no
 * return.
 *
 * Hard guard on init: if `AppData.hasUserOnboarded` is already true, fire
 * [OnboardingEvent.NavigateToHome] immediately so a returning user that
 * lands on the route bounces to Home.
