/**
 * "Check your email" screen logic. The user has just signed up; the auth
 * backend sent them a verification link. We sit on this screen until they
 * confirm.
 *
 * Three triggers refresh the session:
 *  - **I clicked the link** → user-initiated. On `StillPending` we surface
 *    a banner so the user knows we tried and they should re-check the
 *    inbox.
 *  - **Resend** → re-send the verification email; surface rate-limit
 *    errors so the user knows to wait.
 *  - **Foreground resume** → silently retry whenever the screen is
 *    re-resumed. Fires on every return-to-app, including the
 *    same-device `movingeyes://auth/confirmed` deep-link bounce after the
 *    user taps the verification link in their browser. Silent because a
 *    user who switched apps for unrelated reasons shouldn't see a banner
 *    flash on return; the manual button is the explicit surface for
 *    diagnostic feedback.
 *
 * No auto-polling beyond resume — battery + design choice.
 *
 * The constructor [email] arg is nullable to support the cold-launch
 * deep-link path (`movingeyes://auth/confirmed`) where the URL doesn't
 * carry the address. When null, the VM resolves it from the active session
 * via [VerifyEmailAction.ResolveEmailFromSession]; until that lands, the
 * screen reads from [VerifyEmailState.email] which is the provided value
 * or empty string.
