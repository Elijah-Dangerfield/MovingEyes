/**

 * verification email.
 *
 * Email is nullable so the deep-link mapping can land here without the
 * URL having to carry the address (the cold-launch case where the user
 * killed the app before tapping the link in their inbox). The VM resolves
 * the missing email from the active session on init; the screen falls back
 * to a generic body string while the resolve is in flight or if no email
 * is on the session at all.
 *
 * [guestLink] marks the verification as started by an anonymous guest
 * linking an email identity (the claim-account flow), as opposed to a
 * brand-new sign-up or a returning user's unconfirmed-email sign-in. On
 * confirmation the guest keeps their existing progress and account, so
 * they land back on Home instead of re-entering onboarding. The
 * cold-launch deep-link (`movingeyes://auth/confirmed`) can't carry it,
 * so a guest who kills the app between requesting and tapping the link
 * falls back to the plain Home route — never the wrong one.
